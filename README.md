## 👋 Welcome :tada:

🪄 I enjoy math, data viz and making things: [abracadata](https://patricksurry.github.io/)! 

🧭 I'm currently exploring retro computing: [c65](https://github.com/patricksurry/c65/), [TaliForth](https://github.com/SamCoVT/TaliForth2) and [Eastern Front 1941](https://github.com/patricksurry/eastern-front-1941) 

⭐ I built some flight sim tools: [G3](https://github.com/patricksurry/g3) for steam gauges and [pysimconnect](https://github.com/patricksurry/pysimconnect) for FS202x

✈️ I work on data science at [Hopper](https://hts.hopper.com/)
